# pose_correction_app
Correct your neck pose while using phone

## Aim: 
Create an app which will mainly check the pose of neck w.r.t eyes and keep updating in few minutes. If the pose isn't corrected then the app will white/blur the screen.
- Well if this cannot be an app will try to make a chrome extension for further usage.

## Introduction:
Mainly in today's era of people using phone a lot, many are having neck or back pain. This application or github repo aims to showcase what pose is wrong and what needs to be corrected. And vola you have a better pose. 

The next stage would be to measeure the distance of eyes from the screen of phone. --> Will surely have a look on that too.
